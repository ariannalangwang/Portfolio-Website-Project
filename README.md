I built this portfolio website because: <br/>
1) I want a personal website to showcase my side projects. <br/>
2) I want to learn and practice some WebApp skills. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>


Tech stack used: html, css, javascript & Bootstrap4 for styling. <br/>
The website is hosted at: {coming soon} Check it out! <br/>
