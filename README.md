I built this portfolio website because: <br/>
1) I want a personal website to showcase my side projects. <br/>
2) I want to learn and practice some web development skills. <br/>
<br/>

This Website is fully responsive.<br/>
Tech stack used: html, css & Bootstrap4. <br/>
The website is hosted at: ariannalangwang.github.io. Check it out! <br/>
